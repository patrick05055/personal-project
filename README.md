#Smart Alarm App

##"Helping heavy sleepers wake upâ€”one math problem at a time."

#Project Overview
I developed a Flutter-based mobile alarm application specifically designed to assist heavy sleepers in waking up by engaging their minds actively upon waking. This innovative alarm requires users to solve ten randomly generated two-digit addition problems to deactivate the alarm, effectively preventing oversleeping through enforced mental stimulation.

#Main Features
The application allows users to customize their alarm settings by specifying the desired alarm times and selecting specific weekdays for recurring alarms. Once the alarm goes off, it continuously loops until the user successfully solves all ten randomly generated addition problems. The intuitive user interface was carefully designed following Material Design guidelines, ensuring ease of use and a pleasant user experience.

#Technology Stack
For this project, I utilized Flutter and Dart for cross-platform mobile application development, allowing seamless deployment on multiple platforms. The AudioPlayers package was employed to manage the looping alarm audio reliably, and Shared Preferences facilitated persistent storage, ensuring alarms remained active across app restarts. Additionally, Xcode was used to compile and deploy the application specifically for iOS devices.

#Challenges and Lessons Learned
During development, I tackled challenges related to accurately scheduling alarms across different weekdays, managing real-time audio playback, and effectively handling application state. Furthermore, significant effort went into designing an engaging yet simple user interface to motivate users effectively and ensure usability.
